# Airbnb-high-booking-rate-prediction
This project is a part of University of Maryland's BUDT 758T Class Project. It is a class-wide Kaggle like contest to predict whether an Airbnb.com listing will have a high booking rate. The winning team will achieve the highest AUC for the test instances. My project got the second highest AUC of 0.916 on the hidden dataset.
