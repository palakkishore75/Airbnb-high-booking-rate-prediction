# Airbnb-high-booking-rate-prediction
This project is a part of University of Maryland's BUDT 758T Class Project. It is a class-wide Kaggle like contest to predict whether an Airbnb.com listing will have a high booking rate. The winner is decided based on the highest AUC achieved on the hidden test instances. My project got the second highest AUC of 0.916 on the hidden dataset.
